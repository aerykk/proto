# proto

Protobuf files in the `source` directory are compiled into the `build` directory.

## Known Issues

`protoc.exe` may not have been compiled with the correct protobuf version (2.3.0)  
Currently the bent protos are missing some definitions.

## Building

On Windows run `generate.bat`, on Linux/Mac OS X run `generate.sh'.
